config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX
	bool "SmartReflex support"

	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex.

	  SmartReflex can perform continuous dynamic voltage
	  scaling around the nominal operating point voltage
	  according to silicon characteristics and operating
	  conditions. Enabling SmartReflex reduces power
	  consumption.

	  Please note, that by default SmartReflex is only
	  initialized. To enable the automatic voltage
	  compensation for VDD1 and VDD2, user must write 1 to
	  /sys/power/sr_vddX_autocomp, where X is 1 or 2.

config OMAP_SMARTREFLEX_TESTING

	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex testing with SW hardcoded
	  NVALUES intead of E-fuse NVALUES set in factory silicon testing.

	  In some devices the E-fuse values have not been set, even though
	  SmartReflex modules are included. Using these hardcoded values set
	  in software, one can test the SmartReflex features without E-fuse.

	  WARNING: Enabling this option may cause your device to hang!

config OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS

	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.

          switches (e.g. cover switches) via sysfs. Your bootloader has

        depends on OMAP_MUX
        help
